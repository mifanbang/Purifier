#Purifier
Ad Banner Remover for Skype.

#### Introduction

Advertisement banners embedded in Skype are ugly and sometimes steal input focus while we type. Purifier is a launcher bringing a clean Skype back to you. It requires no installation nor modification of system files. Just run it and everything will be cool.

#### Instructions for Use

1. Exit running Skype and make sure it disappeared in the list of Task Manager.
2. Run Purifier.
3. Done.

#### Build

The solution file and project files in this repository are created and maintained with Visual Studio 2012. Please note that Purifier uses DLL injection as its core mechanism and Skype is still built as 32-bit application, so there's no reason to build a 64-bit version of Purifier.

#### Notes on Anti-Virus Software

Some ill-developed anti-virus software may report Purifier as malware. Please do not panic. You can either add Purifier into the exception list of your AV (if you trust the program) or report to me about which AV you use.
