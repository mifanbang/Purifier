#Purifier
Removing Advertisement Banners for Skype.

#### Disclaimers

In addition to the lack of warranty as this software is distributed, the use of this software may lead to violation of the Skype Term of Use and/or any other agreement that you have agreed with Skype Inc. or Microsoft Inc. Please be aware of that you are at your own risk.

#### Introduction

Advertisement banners embedded in Skype are ugly and sometimes steal input focus while we type. Purifier is a launcher bringing a clean Skype back to you. It requires no installation nor modification of system files. Just run it and everything will be cool.

#### Instructions for Use

1. Exit running Skype and make sure it disappeared in the list of Task Manager.
2. Run Purifier.
3. Done.

#### Building the Code

The solution file and project files in this repository are created and maintained with Visual Studio 2015 (get one for free at https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx). Support of various features in C++14 are required if you are building with other compilers. Please also note that Purifier uses DLL injection as its core mechanism and Skype is still built as 32-bit application, so there's no reason to build a 64-bit version of Purifier.

#### Notes on Anti-Virus Software

Some ill-developed anti-virus software may report Purifier as malware. Please do not panic. You can either add Purifier into the exception list of your AV (if you trust this software) or report to me about which AV you use.
